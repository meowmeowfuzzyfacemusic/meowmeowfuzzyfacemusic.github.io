        <h3>hey everyone! i doubt anyone has ever read this, but i really enjoy writing here. i enjoy it so much that i only 
		do it once a year to not spoil the fun. it's like a diary or something. here's a little round up on everything i forgot to put on here.</h3>
		<br>
		<p>i released an album called <i>tvb</i> in February. It's an album i started writing and recording in 2014 (except for one song) and then
		i really loved it but after listening to it for almost 10 years i grew fond of how it sounded unfinished, and some really kind words by my friend
		Sara convinced me to release it this way.</p>
        <br>
        <p> i have another album i'm working on, it's a bit different from the stuff i've been doing recently and i think it's really fun. i'm gonna be
		recording it with some friends soon-ish and i'm really excited about it. more info on that in the coming months.</p>
        <br>
        <p>i made tie dye t-shirts and they're available on bandcamp! here's some examples:</p>

		<img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/0036155037_10.jpg" class="img-fluid" size='120px'>
        <br>
        <p>i found a handful of tapes, i can still make one for you if you want, and still have lots of cd-rs, so i can do that too.</p>
        <br>
		<p>All the meow meow fuzzyface albums are now available on TIDAL, Spotify, Deezer and Youtube. It's kinda funny to see my little drawings and photos on
		real websites. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Would anyone be interested in a meow meow fuzzyface live show?</p>
		<br>
		<p>Until next time, take care!</p>
        <p>Much love,</p>
        <p>meow meow fuzzyface</p>
