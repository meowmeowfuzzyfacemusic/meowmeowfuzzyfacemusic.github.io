        <h1>NEW SONG!!! NEW VIDEO!!! NEW ALBUM!!!!</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>hi everyone! i'm very happy to announce i have a new album coming out next week, it's called <i>good to see
            you're still among the living</i> and it's going to be released on Friday June 2nd.</h3>
        <br>
        <p> It's an entirely instrumental album that i'm very proud of, it deals with how i feel and how i feel about my
          life and the world. It seems pretentious to say an instrumental piece is <i>about</i> something, but it means
          a lot to me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Here you can watch a video i made for the first "single" off the album, it's called "wormy". I think i made a
          pretty good job at depicting what goes on in my head most of the time. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
